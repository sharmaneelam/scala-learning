    * Algorithm
     Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers ii and jj, where ii is the slow-runner while jj is
     the fast-runner. As long as nums[i] = nums[j]nums[i]=nums[j], we increment jj to skip the duplicate.

     When we encounter nums[j] \neq nums[i]nums[j]â‰ nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to
     nums[i + 1]nums[i+1]. ii is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until jj reaches the end of array.
